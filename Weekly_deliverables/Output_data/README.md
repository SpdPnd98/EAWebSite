# Displays

This was the main takeaway: LCD 16x2 screen was a superior choice with respect to OLED due to display size concerns, while the I2s protocol is better in terms of pins usage and neatliness of the project.

We have when through [this link] (https://www.instructables.com/id/LCD-With-I2C/) for a tutorial with an LCD 16x2 screen with I2C protocol and [this link] (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micro-oled-breakout-hookup-guide/all) on a more in depth review of pros and cons of I2C and SPI

# Motors

Based on our estimations, we will need:
- Bilge pumps
- High pressure water pump
- servo motors

Details are noted in the wishlist.
