# Power Requirements

During lesson we were thought the importance and the method to calculate total power consumption.

Power Formula P=V*A
(P=power, V=voltage, A=Amphere)

Using our prototype boat

We stuck 4 Miniature Bilge pumps to the back of our boat. 

At the same time we soldered the each positive wire together and each negative wire together.(Motors are in parallel).

Next we connected terminal blocks and the postive and negative terminals on a stripboard. 

We then connected a DC Power Supply to the other end of the terminal block. Vin to Positive and Ground to Negative.

We placed the boat in water and switch on the output of the supply.

We slowly increased the Voltage, recording the amount of amps needed to drive the boat. 

As the spreadsheet shows, (A) increases as (V) increases. 1 interesting thing to note is that when voltage is at 1.5V the propellers did not rotate and power was at 0 Watts this is due to the insufficient voltage to drive the motors.

Once the voltage reached 2V the propellers started to rotate.

Looking at the spreadsheet power increases due to the voltage and current increasing in value. 
This shows that as voltage increases the power consumption will increase.

And at Max voltage (9V) the power consumption is 24.21W
