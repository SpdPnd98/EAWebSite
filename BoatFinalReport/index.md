# Boat Final Report
## Fabrication Process
### Fabrication of the aluminium frame
We salvaged profiles from the previous project and used the hacksaw to get aluminium profiles with length of 350mm and 230mm. We used 2 of 400mm, 2 of 250mm and 2 of 230mm aluminium profiles. We used mushroom head screws to secure the profiles in place by positioning it with holes drilled along the profile.

### Fabrication of the blue foam

#### Slots fabrication
Initially, we used the hot wire foam cutter to try to cut slots. However, it failed due to inability to control the string’s tension even though the foam was cut into 4 pieces to make it easier to cut. However due to the height of the foam that was going through the string caused it to swing (as seen in figure 1), causing it to cut more. We wanted to try another method which was milling. We used the damaged piece to try testing milling with different speeds (Figure 2)

Figure 2 <img src = "Figure2.jpg"/>

We used a 20 mm drill bit as it was the size of the profile which also meant that there is not much allowance for any errors. After experimenting, we deduced to use 1100 rpm to cut the blue foam. We used 4 of 25mm thick blue foam to mill. We made two pieces each of the design shown in figure 3 and 4. One piece with dimensions from figure 3 and 4 will be placed together with the slots facing each other to form half of the buoyancy device.

#### Holes fabrication
We used a 4 mm drill bit with the same rpm but the rate of decent was slow so as to prevent any damage to the surrounding and to prevent the hole from expanding. To be more precise so as to fit the acrylic perfectly, we continued with the milling machine instead of using the hand drill with manually marking it out with a ruler and tri-square. The dimensions are below.

#### Container holes fabrication
We decided that using the wire cutter will be faster than milling the holes in figure 5 as it was already in 2. As we wanted to create more tension to hold the containers in place, we created a tightening strip as shown in figure 6. This shape was used to allow more compressive forces produced by the container.

#### Curves fabrication
We used the wire cutter to cut a rough estimate along the curve offsetting 3-5 mm from the actual curve so as to ensure that the wire’s variable tension throughout the process does not affect the cut. Then we used the orbital sander to sand it down as it will be smoother, and we can use it along the acrylic piece as a guide. This process was done after the acrylic piece was laser cut.

#### Fabrication of the acrylic piece
We used the laser cutter to fabricate the following holes and shape which aided in cutting the shape we wanted for the blue foam.

### Fabrication of components

We have 3D printed these components

- brackets
- SPeaker holder
- main cannon and holder
- Pirate with the wheel
- Crew with treasure chest
- staircase with wooden crates
- cannons on the outer
- Bilge pump holder

<img src = "all_pictures.jpg"/>

We printed and painted all of these characters with a pirate theme in mind. The paint used is insoluble in water. One of the core components is the Main canon and the holder which is connected to the servo. The Bilge pump holder is also another core part in delivering the proper thrust needed.
